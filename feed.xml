        <title>Week 13</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-do-this-past-week&quot;&gt;What did I do this past week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I wrapped things up with Life, and finally turned the last project in. It feels very satisfying to submit the last assignment, though Test #2 is just a couple of weeks away.
In class we covered more details about inheritance, reviewed dynamic binding and the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and saw the motivation behind the use of abstract classes compared to concrete inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 12</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-do-this-past-week&quot;&gt;What did I do this past week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week I started and almost completed the last project with my partner. It did not go as smoothly as it did with Darwin, but we got it working at the end. We got stuck in the allocation of the cells in the heap, but besides that, the implementation was quite straightforward. We’re planning on writing unit tests early next week.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-do-this-past-week&quot;&gt;What did I do this past week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we finished our custom implementation of vector by integrating the concept of rvalue references in the parameters of the constructor and the copy assignment. We also discussed how we can cast variables to rvalues with the use of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;move&lt;/code&gt; semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It baffles my mind that this was Week 10 of Fall 2016. It feels like a few days ago that I started my exchange year abroad at UT.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-do-this-past-week&quot;&gt;What did I do this past week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I finished the Allocator project (I was done with the coding part very early, but put off writing the unit tests until the end). In class we finished our custom implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;, which seemed straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-do-this-past-week&quot;&gt;What did I do this past week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I started working on the Allocator project. I haven’t done much in terms of coding yet, as setting up the infrastructure took me a while. Hopefully I will be finished by the end of the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we covered more C++ concepts and minutiae in the wake of last Thursday’s test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we covered more C++ topics. It’s starting to get very hairy with all the funny syntax and behaviors that C++ can exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I have wrapped things up with Netflix, and proceeded to close that dark chapter of my time at UT where frustration often took over my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netflix project has been taking most of my week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re barely at the beginning of the semester, and time is gradually becoming a very precious resource.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-i-do-this-past-week&quot;&gt;What did I do this past week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week has been an introductory week, where not much was going on. It’s the end of week two now, and work is already piling up. We dived right into work. Project 1 specifications were released and the submission has been set for next week, new C++ concepts were introduced, new readings are due for next week.&lt;/p&gt;
