        <title>Week 2</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-did-you-do-this-past-week&quot;&gt;What did you do this past week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week has been an introductory week, where not much was going on. Itâ€™s the end of week two now, and work is already piling up. We dived right into work. Project 1 specifications were released and the submission has been set for next week, new C++ concepts were introduced, new readings are due for next week.&lt;/p&gt;
