<p>This past week I started and almost completed the last project with my partner. It did not go as smoothly as it did with Darwin, but we got it working at the end. We got stuck in the allocation of the cells in the heap, but besides that, the implementation was quite straightforward. We’re planning on writing unit tests early next week.</p>

<p>In class, we finally covered the core part of the Object-Oriented language paradigm: inheritance. I find it amusing how it’s Week 11 and we’re barely scratching OOP concepts in class. I feel that most of our time spent in class focuses on C++ minutiae and details. I actually don’t mind this, and do think that it will come in useful when working in the industry.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>Not much has been in my way lately.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>Next week I’ll be wrapping things up with Life, and hopefully start revising for the final test.</p>

<p>This week we finished our custom implementation of vector by integrating the concept of rvalue references in the parameters of the constructor and the copy assignment. We also discussed how we can cast variables to rvalues with the use of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">move</code> semantics.</p>

<p>We then covered the different types of variables in C++ (local, global, class and their static counterparts).</p>

<p>This weekend has been intense! I participated to the <a href="3daystartup.org">3 Day Startup</a> program. My idea (<a href="mentuit.com">Mentuit</a>) was selected as one of the projects of the weekend, and I got to work on it with other talented students. I didn’t much sleep, but it was an incredibly rewarding experience, and I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in startups and entrepreneurship.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>Lack of sleep. I need to recover from this weekend. Hopefully, I’ll be fully recovered in a couple of days.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>Start working on Life.</p>

<p>It baffles my mind that this was Week 10 of Fall 2016. It feels like a few days ago that I started my exchange year abroad at UT.</p>

<p>This week has been relatively easy. Not much going on, apart from introduction to the next project, Darwin. We had one talk on Wednesday from UTCS alumni at Pariveda, and an event for UTCS 50th Anniversary was running on Thursday, which led to class being cancelled.</p>

<p>I started the Darwin project with my partner, and despite having only met once so far and for only a few hours, I think we have a good understanding of the requirements, we have laid out our idea for the software architecture that we want to have in place, and have set plans to meet this weekend.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>Course registrations. Courses I want to take next semester are closed/waitlisted. Despite being a junior, my first registration day is very late because I’m an exchange student and do not have UT credits (from which the schedule is based on) except for the ones of this semester. So, for registration purposes, I’m a freshman. Hopefully my advisor will be able to help me out.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>I’ll work on Darwin and register for classes.</p>

<p>This week I finished the Allocator project (I was done with the coding part very early, but put off writing the unit tests until the end). In class we finished our custom implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">vector</code>, which seemed straightforward.</p>

<p>This week has been surprisingly productive for me. It’s not academic productivity, however. I figured out the final details of a project I’d been working the last few months, and I launched it this weekend!</p>

<p><a href="http://mentuit.com">Mentuit</a> is an online platform that connects to motivated individuals to experts in particular fields, and helps them develop a mentoring relationship.</p>

<p>The problem I am trying to solve is that it’s difficult, yet critically important nowadays, to have access to mentors that can open doors for you. I want to build a great community and network of mentors and mentees with Mentuit.</p>

	     <h2 id="what-did-i-do-this-past-week">What did I do this past week?</h2>
<p>This week I started working on the Allocator project. I haven’t done much in terms of coding yet, as setting up the infrastructure took me a while. Hopefully I will be finished by the end of the weekend.</p>

<p>In class we covered some aspects of arrays in C++, we clarified some details about the heap and the stack, and started exploring the implementation of vectors.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>The two CS projects due next week are my priority at the moment. I always hope for a smooth progress with coding projects, but eventually always end up being stuck somewhere. That’s part of learning, clearly, but I hate when it happens. And I hate knowing that it will happen, whether I want it or not.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>Next week I’ll be working on CS projects and a presentation for a startup competition.</p>

<p>This week we covered more C++ concepts and minutiae in the wake of last Thursday’s test.</p>

<p>We learned about a few types of new pointers in C++, originating from the combination of the concept of constants with the ones of pointer. So, we have now four new types of pointers differing in the immutable nature of either the pointer or of what the pointer is pointing to.</p>

<p>We also saw some ways in which C++ caches constants in memory. If we have <code class="highlighter-rouge">const char* a = "abc"</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">const char* b = "abc"</code>, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">assert(a == b)</code>.</p>

<p>The test itself was manageable, though I’m unsure about my implementation of the custom C++ iterator.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>Last week I received a summer internship offer from Salesforce (if you’ve been an intern with them in the past, please, get in touch–I’d love to hear your experience!).
Now, two other companies have decided to schedule interviews next week because of the deadline of my first offer. While I’m grateful that they try to accommodate me, it’s looking like it will be stressful week coming up.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>Mostly interview prep, and prepare for my Management exam.</p>

<p>This week we covered more C++ topics. It’s starting to get very hairy with all the funny syntax and behaviors that C++ can exhibit.</p>

<p>I’ve tried going through the examples we covered in class and running similar ones on my machine. I still did very poorly on the last quiz, which covered the execution of different types of constructors.</p>

<p>So here’s a breakdown of what we learned this week:</p>

<ul>
  <li>iterators and their behavior in different contexts</li>
  <li>refinement overwriting</li>
  <li>constructors</li>
  <li>friends</li>
  <li>that friends can touch each other privates</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>Exam 1 is coming up next week. I have two other exams next week, as well as regular weekly project deadlines, and will need to really schedule my time properly.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>Mostly try to survive. I have started following my review schedule two days ago, and I’m not falling behind yet!</p>

<p>This week I have wrapped things up with Netflix, and proceeded to close that dark chapter of my time at UT where frustration often took over my sanity.</p>

<p>I learned different things by working on the Netflix project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C++ should not be at top of your list for machine learning,</li>
  <li>Serialization is great if it works,</li>
  <li>Having an isolated development environment/container like Docker is great if you can get everything set up in it,</li>
  <li>Don’t share a single Travis-CI worker with 160 more people, running computationally expensive jobs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides reflecting on Netflix, this week we explored some more C++ concepts, including the different types of iterators and the whole notion of function definition with the weakest possible iterator. We had also had an illuminating talk about software development at JPL.</p>

<p>I’ve also been to the CNS Career Fair on Tuesday and it was a great opportunity to talk to employers and getting to know the companies that they were representing.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>Lack of time is on my way. Interviewing for internships while taking a full load of courses requires a great deal of prioritizing and compromising. It hasn’t been too bad though.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>Next week I’ll make a plan to review for tests and exams.</p>

<p>The Netflix project has been taking most of my week.</p>

<p>In class we explored more details about pointers and references. We saw generics in C++ templating, the different types of iterators. We had a talk from a UT alumnus who is now working at Bloomberg.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>I was very surprised by this coursework, as it involves training a recommender system with over 2 GB of data. The task does not really relate to Object-Oriented Programming. The only thing relevant to the course is that it has to be written in C++.</p>

<p>I do not mind the challenge of exploring machine learning in an OOP class. I’ve always been interested in machine learning and data analytics. I think it makes sense for CS373 (which uses Python), and I still see it a bit forced in the context of Object-Oriented Programming, especially considering that no libraries are allowed in the code. And not exclusively machine learning libraries, but linear algebra frameworks that are essential in any learning algorithm–they are not allowed either.</p>

<p>Another thing that I found frustrating are the tools that we are using. Boost has been recommended for data serialization. It took me hours to learn it, only to discover that support in the UTCS machines, Docker container, and Travis build are lacking. It’s been working on my machine as expected, but the location of the libraries in the ‘official’ infrastructure has not been verified by the instructor.</p>

<p>The new Github Classroom set up has been causing some problems as well. It was not building the tests for many students, and it caused me a lot of wasted time trying to troubleshoot, when it was the class account setup that was faulty.</p>

<p>I see the benefits of the set of tools we are using, but it would be great if they could be tested thoroughly before being released to hundreds of students.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>I will be mainly finishing the Netflix project.</p>

<p>I’ll prepare and go for to the CNS Career Fair.</p>

	     <h2 id="what-did-i-do-this-past-week">What did I do this past week?</h2>
<p>We’re barely at the beginning of the semester, and time is gradually becoming a very precious resource.</p>

<p>The first project deadline was this week, and I think I handled my priorities very well, having worked on most of the tasks early.</p>

<p>This week we covered pointers and references in C++. It gets very verbose and confusing at times, but as professor Downing said, the key to understanding these concepts really boils down to sitting at your desk and trying it out yourself.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pointers.png" alt="Relevant " /></p>

<p>This week I’ve also been to the Engineering EXPO. It’s my first carrier fair in the US, and it’s really an event that does not compare to what we have in the UK. Carrier fairs across the pond are of much smaller scale, and it’s mostly an opportunity for employers to publicize their brand, rather than an opportunity to actively hire talent.</p>

<p>It went very well, and managed to get a few interviews lined up for next week. When I didn’t have the chance to achieve something concrete, I still treasured it as an opportunity to talk to employers and practice the art of talking and showing what I’m passionate about.</p>

<p>This week I also had the opportunity to attend a talk by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe">Bob Metcalfe</a> as part of the Longhorn Startup Seminar class I am taking. It was a great talk, and touched on some decisions I have been struggling with: “should I focus on getting a job at a tech company or try to start my own thing?”</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>Too many things to do. Coursework is taking most of my time. Having a part-time job where I get to code is great, but also very time consuming. Practicing for interviews is also at the top of my priority list, but I haven’t been able to focus on it more than I wanted.</p>

<p>Thankfully, as a Computer Scientist, I tend to keep my social endeavours as little as possible, but it’s helped my sanity to go out and meet some friends.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>Next week I will try to find meaning in the things that I do. There are things that I do everyday that I almost take for granted, and want to find happiness and gratitude in the things that I get to do. This has kept me from being overwhelmed by the many things I have to do.</p>

<p>I’ll also try to find a partner for Project 2. I am really keen on working with someone else, so if you’re interested, feel free to <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#109;&#101;&#064;&#103;&#105;&#111;&#118;&#097;&#110;&#110;&#105;&#097;&#108;&#099;&#097;&#110;&#116;&#097;&#114;&#097;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">contact me</a> and we can talk about it.</p>
