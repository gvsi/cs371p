<p>Earlier this week I wrapped things up with Life, and finally turned the last project in. It feels very satisfying to submit the last assignment, though Test #2 is just a couple of weeks away.
In class we covered more details about inheritance, reviewed dynamic binding and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">virtual</code> keyword, and saw the motivation behind the use of abstract classes compared to concrete inheritance.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>Exams. Luck wanted me to have three exams scheduled on Thursday, December 1st. And that includes Object-Oriented Programming. If I don’t start revising during the Thanksgiving break, it will be bad.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>Enjoy a break, and start revising.</p>
