	     <h2 id="what-did-i-do-this-past-week">What did I do this past week?</h2>
<p>This week I finished the Allocator project (I was done with the coding part very early, but put off writing the unit tests until the end). In class we finished our custom implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">vector</code>, which seemed straightforward.</p>

<p>This week has been surprisingly productive for me. It’s not academic productivity, however. I figured out the final details of a project I’d been working the last few months, and I launched it this weekend!</p>

<p><a href="http://mentuit.com">Mentuit</a> is an online platform that connects to motivated individuals to experts in particular fields, and helps them develop a mentoring relationship.</p>

<p>The problem I am trying to solve is that it’s difficult, yet critically important nowadays, to have access to mentors that can open doors for you. I want to build a great community and network of mentors and mentees with Mentuit.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>Not much has been in my way.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>Next week I’ll try to get started on the Darwin project.</p>

<h2 id="tip-of-the-week">Tip of the week</h2>
<p><a href="http://mentuit.com">Mentuit</a>, check it out! You can sign up as a mentor, mentee, or both if you want! I would also appreciate your feedback!</p>
