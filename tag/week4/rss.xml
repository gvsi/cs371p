<p>This week I have wrapped things up with Netflix, and proceeded to close that dark chapter of my time at UT where frustration often took over my sanity.</p>

<p>I learned different things by working on the Netflix project:
- C++ should not be at top of your list for machine learning,
- Serialization is great if it works,
- Having an isolated development environment/container like Docker is great if you can get everything set up in it,
- Don’t share with a single Travis-CI worker with 160 more people, running computationally expensive jobs.</p>

<p>Besides reflecting on Netflix, this week we explored some more C++ concepts, including the different types of iterators and the whole notion of function definition with the weakest possible iterator. We had also had an illuminating talk about software development at JPL.</p>

<p>I’ve also been to the CNS Career Fair on Tuesday and it was a great opportunity to talk to employers and getting to know the companies that they were representing.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>Lack of time is on my way. Interviewing for internships while taking a full load of courses requires a great deal of prioritizing and compromising. It hasn’t been too bad though.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>Next week I’ll make a plan to review for tests and exams.</p>

<p><a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>. We talked about MapReduce in class, and if you’re really interested in distributed computation, you should consider learning the framework inspired by the work at Google. Also, I’m taking a Big Data Programming class which teaches Hadoop and Spark this semester, and you should check that out as well.</p>

<p>The Netflix project has been taking most of my week.</p>

<p>In class we explored more details about pointers and references. We saw generics in C++ templating, the different types of iterators. We had a talk from a UT alumnus who is now working at Bloomberg.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-my-way">What’s in my way?</h2>
<p>I was very surprised by this coursework, as it involves training a recommender system with over 2 GB of data. The task does not really relate to Object-Oriented Programming. The only thing relevant to the course is that it has to be written in C++.</p>

<p>I do not mind the challenge of exploring machine learning in an OOP class. I’ve always been interested in machine learning and data analytics. I think it makes sense for CS373 (which uses Python), and I still see it a bit forced in the context of Object-Oriented Programming, especially considering that no libraries are allowed in the code. And not exclusively machine learning libraries, but linear algebra frameworks that are essential in any learning algorithm–they are not allowed either.</p>

<p>Another thing that I found frustrating are the tools that we are using. Boost has been recommended for data serialization. It took me hours to learn it, only to discover that support in the UTCS machines, Docker container, and Travis build are lacking. It’s been working on my machine as expected, but the location of the libraries in the ‘official’ infrastructure has not been verified by the instructor.</p>

<p>The new Github Classroom set up has been causing some problems as well. It was not building the tests for many students, and it caused me a lot of wasted time trying to troubleshoot, when it was the class account setup that was faulty.</p>

<p>I see the benefits of the set of tools we are using, but it would be great if they could be tested thoroughly before being released to hundreds of students.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-next-week">What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>I will be mainly finishing the Netflix project.</p>

<p>I’ll prepare and go for to the CNS Career Fair.</p>

<p><a href="http://habitica.com">Habitica</a> has been motivating me for over 2 years to accomplish small daily productive habits with gamification (e.g. read a few pages from a book, write a daily journal, meditate, read an article from the Hacker News, etc). Check it out!</p>
