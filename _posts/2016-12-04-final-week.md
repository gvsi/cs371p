## Final thoughts
After Thursday's final exam, my first exchange semester at UT Austin is coming to a close. It's been an incredible ride, and part of this is thanks for Prof. Downing's OOP class.
This course was not easy, but that's what made it incredibly rewarding at the end. Learning details of C++ and proper Object-Oriented design seems like a trival task, but it's what I believe will set apart successful software engineers in the industry.
The final exam was not as bad as I expectedâ€“I panicked a bit going through the questions, but keeping a calm attitude, I did manage to tackle each problem. These were testing topics ranging from inherance, to design pattern design (singleton) and general C++ classes implementation.
Prof. Downing is easily one of the best professor I've ever had. He showed incredible passion, combined with his  great understanding of the subject and an entrenched desire to shape the next generation of successful software engineers. He strives to make his courses industry-oriented, with a focus on using the standard tools currently in use in companies' development workflows.
Overall, this was a great course, and would highly recommend it to anyone doing a Computer Science/Software Engineering degree.
