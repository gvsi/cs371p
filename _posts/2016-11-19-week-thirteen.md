## What did I do this past week?
Earlier this week I wrapped things up with Life, and finally turned the last project in. It feels very satisfying to submit the last assignment, though Test #2 is just a couple of weeks away.
In class we covered more details about inheritance, reviewed dynamic binding and the `virtual` keyword, and saw the motivation behind the use of abstract classes compared to concrete inheritance. 

## What's in my way?
Exams. Luck wanted me to have three exams scheduled on Thursday, December 1st. And that includes Object-Oriented Programming. If I don't start revising during the Thanksgiving break, it will be bad.

## What will I do next week?
Enjoy a break, and start revising.

## Tip of the week
