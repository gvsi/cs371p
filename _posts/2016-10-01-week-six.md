## What did I do this past week?
This week we covered more C++ topics. It's starting to get very hairy with all the funny syntax and behaviors that C++ can exhibit.

I've tried going through the examples we covered in class and running similar ones on my machine. I still did very poorly on the last quiz, which covered the execution of different types of constructors.

So here's a breakdown of what we learned this week:

- iterators and their behavior in different contexts
- refinement overwriting
- constructors
- friends
- that friends can touch each other privates

## What's in my way?
Exam 1 is coming up next week. I have two other exams next week, as well as regular weekly project deadlines, and will need to really schedule my time properly.

## What will I do next week?
Mostly try to survive. I have started following my review schedule two days ago, and I'm not falling behind yet!

## Tip of the week
[Hackerrank's Cracking the Coding Interview Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview) has just been published. It contains videos on interview techniques that the author of CTCI filmed, as well as a collection of problems that you can solve on Hackerrank's online IDE.

Also, O'Reilly has just published list of free ebooks that you can download online. Here's the [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/556kxj/oreilly_offering_programming_ebooks_for_free/).
