## What did I do this past week?
This week I started working on the Allocator project. I haven't done much in terms of coding yet, as setting up the infrastructure took me a while. Hopefully I will be finished by the end of the weekend. 

In class we covered some aspects of arrays in C++, we clarified some details about the heap and the stack, and started exploring the implementation of vectors.

## What's in my way?
The two CS projects due next week are my priority at the moment. I always hope for a smooth progress with coding projects, but eventually always end up being stuck somewhere. That's part of learning, clearly, but I hate when it happens. And I hate knowing that it will happen, whether I want it or not.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I'll be working on CS projects and a presentation for a startup competition.
